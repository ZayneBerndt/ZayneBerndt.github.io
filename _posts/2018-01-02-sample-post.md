title: Why change is good and why we need it.
---
In early 2014 I found myself trekking to the base camp of Mt Everest, Nepal. It’s the beautiful place you see on the cover photos of countless mountaineering magazines and a place many hiking enthusiasts aspire to visit. I was a full time traveller, a thing I had never done before. It was both exhilarating and scary, but what I got out of it was so much more valuable than I could have imagined.

If we fast forward to today, 2018. I find myself in a new part of the world about to embark on a new journey, entering a career I couldn’t have thought would fit my skill set. Between today and my days in paradise in Nepal allot has happened and a lot of things changed.

>Over the last few years I’ve realised that to make progress and learn, you’ll need to make changes. You need to challenge yourself to make changes. You need to set goals, hit them and then set new goals. Always try to challenge yourself. This will make learning fun and challenging.

I jotted a couple of things down that I think helped me and which may be able to help you to achieve progress in the future too:

1. Listening: a key skill for everything. Not only listening to people that you think can teach you something. No, listen to anyone. Everyone has a story. If people say they don’t have one then they haven’t realised it yet. However, this skill is hard and takes some practice. When you pay attention to other people’s stories and opinions you’ll realise how they are doing things differently from you. That’s what you have to capitalise on in order to apply these changes to your own life.

2. Get involved and have an open mind: Don’t limit yourself to only the things you’re interested in. This is even more difficult to achieve than listening. You are comfortable with the things you’re interested in. These are the things you always fall back on. I don’t say you should ditch your interests but have an open mind and supplement your interests. For instance, I enjoy working with Tableau and playing with data — but I didn’t know much about scripting languages. You don’t need to know the latter to be successful with Tableau but I decided it might help me. I made progress by challenging myself to learn something that supplements the things I already knew.

3. Surround yourself with smart(er) people: I count myself blessed to have worked with driven people. Clever colleagues will always challenge you. There hasn’t been a day that I haven’t learned anything — and this is not only limited to professional learning. Smart people make changes all the time in order to further progress. You can learn from them.

4. Don’t be scared: Easier said, harder to put into practice. For example, before I started training in programming, I had a very limited knowledge on software and even IT in general let alone work with someone on a joint web application. 3 years ago I couldn’t have imagined I would ever be a Junior Web Developer, now I love it. It’s so much fun to share knowledge. In order to tackle nervousness or feeling scared, I more and more ask myself the question ‘Why Not?’. If I can’t find a really good reason not to do it I will do it. Of course there have been times I felt constrained and often I’ve failed but these are also the moments you learn the most.

When you feel you are too comfortable in your current situation you should try and find something you can change. Often this involves challenging yourself. As we’ve just entered 2018 you could focus on resolutions but these are often hard to maintain. It’s easier to create short term goals that lead to something bigger. If you keep on challenging yourself to get out of your comfort zone you also start automating more and more of what you before considered “out of your comfort zone”.

This is why I believe change is good. You can only progress yourself to a certain goal by making changes and that’s when you start making an impact.
