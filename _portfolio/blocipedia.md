## Explanation

Wikis are a great way to collaborate on community-sourced content. Whether the wiki is for a hobby or work-related project, I have build an app that lets users create their own wikis and share them publicly or privately with other collaborators.



## User Stories

As a user I want to:
<br/>


1. Sign up with a user name, password and email.
2. Sign in and out of Blocipedia.
3. With a standard account be able to create, read, update, and delete public wikis.
4. Upgrade their account from a free to a paid plan.
5. Create private wikis.
6. Create and edit wikis using Markdown syntax.
7. Have a premium subscription and be able to add and remove collaborators for their private wikis.


## Solution

The aim is to use Ruby on Rails CRUD and develop exploring different Gems. I want to create user accounts for free public, private and admin users. I use Heroku to deploy the project and for hosting and seed data using SQL lite. Explore integrating third party API's into the app.
