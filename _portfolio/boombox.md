## Explanation
Welcome to Bömbox. Work in Progress, Bömbox is my capstone project where by I collaborate with a designer, engineer and a business associate.  As a team of four, the aim is to take our product to the market. We each play a unique role in working on our project to each develop individual skills as well as push each other forward as a team.


## Aim

As a leading hand in the project I am responsible for driving the team forward on initiatives trying to incorporate as much Agile methodologies where possible as well as other project management tools trying to emulate a real working life environment.  

Having no previous working experience of working in a development team my main focus of this project is to collaborate with designers and other developers to experience and work toward efficient work flows, build up confidence, understand more of the design workflow and teach myself how to best cross communicate as part of a working dev team.

## Solution
<strong>1. Set up working environment</strong>

From the very start I encouraged and emulated an Agile working environment. I tried to lay down foundations for clear transparent communication at all times. I learnt and am still learning allot about project management techniques and using tools such as Gantt Charts where by we are all held accountable to our tasks and strive to reach our own deadlines.

<strong>2. We conducted requirement surveys</strong>

It is very apparent to me that understanding the end users needs are the most important factor to developing any product. We wanted data and we wanted more direction so we conducted many surveys.

<strong>3. Planned </strong>

Once we collated enough data we put together a plan on what features we needed and the design of the app. We iterated through many drafts until we came up with something brilliant.

<strong>4. Designed </strong>

Once we agreed on our initial design of the app we put together our "look". This involved collaborating on colour, typography and feasibility of future development.

## Conclusion

Even though the project is in the early stages the knowledge and experience of working with a team remotely has proven invaluable and I feel there is allot of skill that is transferable for future team work.
