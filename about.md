Hi I'm Zayne.
I'm a <strong>Junior Full Stack Developer</strong> , I write and understand many different languages but only speak english ðŸ¤”. I live in Cardiff but call many places home.
Being inquisitive by nature has lead me into a diverse career path in many different countries. My experiences have allowed me to work alongside many talented people in their respective fields through which I have learnt the value in versatility and the strength in having a constant liberal approach to life and work.
To me the best part of my journey to becoming a Junior Developer is being part of a whole new community. A community that like me wants to change the world for the better!
